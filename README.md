# Gyankunja3.0
This is our third repository for our 5th-semester college project - Gyankunja. We aim to provide a tool for students, teachers, and learners to sell their notes and make some income. We started this project around May 2021. With some ruckus of COVID-19 and lockdowns as well as waiting for 4th-semester exams we are now in December and the project is a lil late to bloom but we are getting there slowly and steadily day by day. On this iteration of our project, a lot of things are changed and especially in the backend. File names, front end, and backend have got more defined and systemized. The files contain HTML, CSS, and PHP files for the frontend and backend for signup and login. Users are able to create an account now and log in and log out of their sessions. There is a frontend for the profile page, home page, and discussion hub, however, it is yet to be defined clearly and work remains for the backend. We hope to complete this thing around the next few months to move on to further projects while continuing to build this project into a better version day by day. Group members: Dhiraj, Deepak, Deshant, and Subash. Vedas College, CSIT-075, 5th semester.
